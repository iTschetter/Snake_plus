This is my take on the classic, retro snake game. This game includes a single player version and a local multiplayer version where you can compete against someone for the highest score. This project works with the MAMP MySQL service to make the leaderboard feature function properly -- it is required to get this working.

This is a final project for my Advanced Data Structures class.

Here are some screenshots of the game:
